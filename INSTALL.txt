Directions for installation:

1) Make a new empty directory and move wordle2.zip into this folder. The
contents of the zip will be extracted here.

2) In the command prompt, change your working directory to the directory
containing the zip file. Type "unzip wordle2.zip".

4) Package installation. We assume you have OPAM installed. In terminal, execute
the following:
4a) Run "opam switch create wordle ocaml-base-compiler.4.12.0"
4b) Run "opam switch wordle"
4c) Run "opam install -y utop odoc ounit2 qcheck bisect_ppx menhir ocaml-lsp-server ocamlformat ocamlformat-rpc ANSITerminal dune"

3) In the working directory (the folder that contains the wordle files, not the folder that contains the entire unzipped wordle folder), type "dune build". Ignore the warnings, they do not
break the program. This is a WIP after all!

4) Type "make play". Enjoy the game!
